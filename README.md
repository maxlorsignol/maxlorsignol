## Who I Am

I am passionate about blending technology and environmental science to create data-driven solutions for sustainable resource management. My work and studies focus on:
- **Forestry**: Assessing old-growth forest management and conservation using historical imagery and NDVI.
- **Marine and Terrestrial Ecosystems**: Analyzing habitat connectivity and fragmentation in areas like Howe Sound.
- **GIS & Remote Sensing**: Using platforms like ArcGIS, Google Earth Engine, and FME for spatial problem-solving.

When I‚Äôm not working on geospatial projects, you can find me **woodworking**, building **custom van interiors**, or exploring the great outdoors through **mountaineering**.
